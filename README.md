# Description

Heroku [recently announced](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter) that they are going to deprecate free resources (free plan for Heroku Dynos, free plan for Heroku Postgres, etc.). That's a pisser. So, I am hunting round for alternatives. The first one I am looking at is [Render](https://render.com/). I thought I would create a little React / Node.js app to try out Render.

# TODO

* ~~Use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to spin up a project~~
* ~~Add a basic form to allow an input string to be entered which we reverse after clicking a button~~
* ~~Add a basic Express app to serve out the single page application~~
* ~~Deploy the web app to Render~~
* ~~Add tests~~
* ~~Add server-side logging~~
* ~~Add Google Analytics~~
* Move the reversing of the string from client-side to server-side
* Add a PostgreSQL database to record each request to reverse a string
* Use GitHub Actions to run tests and deploy to Render
  * https://community.render.com/t/github-actions-render/800
